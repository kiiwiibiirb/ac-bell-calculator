# ac-bell-calculator
This is a lua script that can help you determine how many bells you will get from selling bugs/fish

# How to use:
You will need to install lua, then run one of the lua scripts based on what you want to sell (either `lua fish.lua` or `lua bugs.lua`) You will then be asked questions to see how many bells you will get.

# TODO
### Bugs
- [x] Have all bugs in table

- [x] Have all bugs accessable

- [x] Have all fish in table

- [x] Have all fish accessable

### Other

# NOTE!!!
Typing in the bugs/fish are case sensitive! Each word has to begin with an
uppercase letter (ex: walking leaf would be Walking Leaf)
