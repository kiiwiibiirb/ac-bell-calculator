# Important
This was my first go at finishing something in a programming language, now that I've gotten the handle of it I will work on a better version of this, that will be much more user-friendly. Stay tuned for that :)

# Kiiwii's Animal Crossing Bell Calculator!
This is my Animal Crossing Bell Calculator (or ACBC for short). You can calculate the bells of any item* in Animal Crossing New Horizons with any quantity!

(* I'm still working on adding everything, right now you can only find the price for fish, bugs and fruit!)

# Requirements
In order to use this program, you will need Lua installed. In Linux you will just need to find it in your package manager (it's most likely called `lua` or `lua5.3`). I'm not sure how to install Lua under Windows or macOS as I don't run those Operating Systems, sorry.

(I will either rewrite this program to add a GUI or make a web interface so users don't have to go through the trouble of installing Lua just to use this program)

# Why the fuck is fish-and-bugs.lua over 100kb????
Because I'm a dumbass and put over 1000 of if-else statements when there's an easier way to go about it. Once I figure out how to slim it down (which from what a friend has showed me is really small) I'll update it :)

# When are you gonna add xyz??
When I get around to it. I'm not one to work on stuff on a schedule, especially since this isn't that dire for me to do as it's just a fun project I wanna do. Hopefully I'll have everything that's available in Animal Crossing all in one `.lua` file, but for now it's a bit limited. Sorry about that.
